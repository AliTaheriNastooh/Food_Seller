# Food_Seller
 Vending_Machine


In this project you are about to design a food seller machine using vending machine and FSM paradigms. 
For this reason, you have money and choice as inputs and available items, item and remaining money as outputs. 
Your machine must take money from consumer and show available items with that amount and wait for 10 clocks for consumer's choice. 
If consumer selected something among available items, machine must deliver the item and if there is any remaining money, 
it should be returned too. If consumer chose something among unavailable items, machine should return and error and start counting again. 
Any added feature has added value. For items of machine, use these values:
 Soda: 100
 Chips: 011
 Ice cream: 001
 Water: 010
